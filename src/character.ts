    "About Hyperliquid: Overall summary. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/about-hyperliquid/core-contributors. About Hyperliquid What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a performant L1 optimized from the ground up. The vision is a fully onchain open financial system with user built applications interfacing with performant native components, all without compromising end user experience. The Hyperliquid L1 is performant enough to operate an entire ecosystem of permissionless financial applications – every order, cancel, trade, and liquidation happens transparently on-chain with block latency <1 second. The chain currently supports 100k orders / second. The Hyperliquid L1 uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT which is heavily inspired by Hotstuff and its successors. Both the algorithm and networking stack are optimized from the ground up to support the L1. The flagship native application is a fully onchain order book perpetuals exchange, the Hyperliquid DEX. Further developments include a native token standard, spot trading, permissionless liquidity, etc.",
    "Core contributors: Details about the key contributors to the Hyperliquid project. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/about-hyperliquid/core-contributors. Core contributors Hyperliquid Labs is a core contributor supporting the growth of Hyperliquid, led by Jeff and iliensinc, who are classmates from Harvard. Other members of the team are from Caltech and MIT and previously worked at Airtable, Citadel, Hudson River Trading, and Nuro. The team used to do proprietary market making in crypto in 2020 and expanded into defi in the summer of 2022. Existing platforms were plagued with issues, such as poor market design, bad tech, and clunky UX. It was easy to make money trading on these protocols, but disappointing to see how far behind defi was compared to its centralized counterparts. The team set out to build a product that could solve these issues and provide users with a seamless trading experience. Designing a performant decentralized L1 including a perpetuals order book DEX requires an intimate understanding of quantitative trading, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and clean UX, which the team is well-positioned to deliver. The team actively engages with and listens to the community; you are welcome to join the Discord server to ask any questions and share feedback. Lastly, Hyperliquid Labs is self-funded and has not taken any external capital, which allows the team to focus on building a product they believe in without external pressure.",
    "L1 overview: An overview of Hyperliquid's Layer 1 blockchain architecture and features. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/l1-overview.L1. overview Consensus The Hyperliquid L1 is secured by HyperBFT, a variant of HotStuff consensus. Like most proof of stake chains, blocks are produced by validators in proportion to the native token staked to each validator. Execution The Hyperliquid L1 state comprises native financial components as well as a general purpose EVM (currently testnet only). The native financial components include margin and matching engine state. Importantly, Hyperliquid does not rely on the crutch of off-chain order books. A core design principle is full decentralization with one consistent order of transactions achieved through HyperBFT consensus. Latency Consensus currently uses an optimized consensus algorithm called HyperBFT, which is optimized for end-to-end latency. End-to-end latency is measured as duration between sending request to receiving committed response. For an order placed from a geographically co-located client, end-to-end latency has a median 0.2 seconds and 99th percentile 0.9 seconds. This performance allows users to port over automated strategies from other crypto venues with minimal changes and gives retail users instant feedback through the UI. Throughput Mainnet currently supports approximately 100k orders/sec. The current bottleneck is execution. The consensus algorithm and networking stack can scale to millions of orders per second once the execution can keep up. There are plans to further optimize the execution logic once the need arises.",
    "Staking: Information on staking mechanisms, rewards, and participation processes. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/staking. Staking Basics HYPE staking on the Hyperliquid L1 happens within the staking native component. Just as USDC can be transferred between perps and spot accounts, HYPE can be transferred between spot and staking accounts. Within the staking account, HYPE may be staked to any number of validators. Here and in other docs, delegate and stake are used interchangeably, as the Hyperliquid L1 only supports delegated proof of stake. Each validator has a self-delegation requirement of 10000 HYPE to become active. Once active, validators produce blocks and receive rewards proportional to their total delegated stake. Validators may charge a commission to their delegators. This commission cannot be increased unless the new commission is less than or equal to 1%. This prevents scenarios where a validator attracts a large amount of stake and then raises the commission significantly to take advantage of unaware stakers. Delegations to a particular validator have a lockup duration of 1 day. After this lockup, delegations may be partially or fully undelegated at any time. Undelegated balances instantly reflect in staking account balance. Transfers from spot account to staking account are instant. However, transfers from staking account to spot account have a 7 day unstaking queue. Most other proof of stake chains have a similar mechanism, which ensures that large-scale consensus attacks are penalized by slashing or social layer mechanisms. There is currently no automatic slashing implemented on the L1. The staking reward rate formula is inspired by Ethereum, where the reward rate is inversely proportional to the square root of total HYPE staked. At 400M total HYPE staked, the yearly reward rate is approximately 2.37% per year. Staking rewards come from the future emissions reserve. Rewards are accrued every minute and distributed to stakers every day. Rewards are redelegated automatically to the staked validator, i.e. compounded. Technical Details The notion of a quorum is essential to modern proof of stake consensus algorithms such as HyperBFT. A quorum is any set of validators that has more than ⅔ of the total stake in the network. The operating requirement of consensus is that a quorum of stake is honest (non-Byzantine). Therefore it is an essential responsibility of every staker to only delegate to trusted validators. HyperBFT consensus proceeds in rounds, which is a fundamental discrete bundle of transactions along with signatures from a quorum of validators. Each round may be committed after certain conditions are met, after which it is sent to the execution state for processing. A key property of the consensus algorithm is that all honest nodes agree on the ordered list of committed rounds. Rounds may result in a new execution state block. Execution blocks are indexed by a separate increasing counter called height. Height only increments on consensus rounds with at least one transaction. The validator set evolves in epochs of 100000 rounds, which is approximately 30 minutes on mainnet. The validators and consensus stakes are static for each staking epoch. Validators may vote to jail peers that do not respond with adequate latency or frequency to the consensus messages of the voter. Upon receiving a quorum of jail votes, a validator becomes jailed and no longer participates in consensus. A jailed validator does not produce rewards for its delegators. A validator may unjail themselves by diagnosing and fixing the causes, subject to onchain unjailing rate limits. Note that jailing is not the same slashing, which is reserved for provably malicious behavior such as double-signing blocks at the same round.",
    "HyperEVM: Details about Hyperliquid's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/hyperevm. HyperEVM (Testnet-only) Hyperliquid L1 features a general purpose EVM as part of the blockchain state. Importantly, the HyperEVM is not a separate chain, but rather secured by the same HyperBFT consensus as the rest of the L1. This lets the EVM interact directly with the native components of the L1, such as spot and perp order books. For example, ERC20 tokens are fungible with their linked native spot asset. Users can trade a project token with minimal fees and deep liquidity on the native spot order book, and seamlessly use the same asset on applications built on the EVM. The HyperEVM and its interactions with the L1 are under active development. For the latest technical developments, seehttps://app.gitbook.com/o/9IEyz6nVB2XCF7KcJ16H/s/yUdp569E6w18GdfqlGvJ/~/changes/484/for-developers/evm",
    "Bridge: Explains the cross-chain bridge for asset transfers between networks. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/bridge. Bridge Hyperliquid runs with an EVM bridge that is secured by the same validator set as the Hyperliquid L1. Deposits to the bridge are signed by validators on the L1 and are credited when more than 2/3 of the staking power has signed the deposit. Withdrawals from the L1 are immediately escrowed on the L1, and validators sign the withdrawal as separate L1 transactions. When 2/3 of the staking power has signed the L1 withdrawal, an EVM transaction can be sent to the bridge to request the withdrawal. After a withdrawal is requested, there is a dispute period during which the bridge can be locked for a malicious withdrawal that does not match the L1. Cold wallet signatures of 2/3 of the stake-weighted validator set are required to unlock the bridge. After the dispute period, finalization transactions are sent, which distribute the USDC to the corresponding destination addresses. There is a similar mechanism to maintain the set of active validators and their corresponding stake on the bridge contract. Withdrawals do not require any Arbitrum ETH from the user. Instead, a withdrawal fee of 1 USDC is paid by the user on the L1 to cover the Arbitrum gas costs of the validators. The bridge and its logic in relation to the L1 staking have been audited by Zellic. See the Hyperliquid github repository for the full bridge code, and the Audits section for the audit reports.",
    "API servers: Documentation on using Hyperliquid's API servers for integrations. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/api-servers.  API servers The API servers are permissionless, other than the validating nodes allowing direct connectivity via RPC. Essentially the API servers act as non-validating proxies to the network. The design allows anyone with access to a node RPC (which will ultimately be public) to spin up arbitrary sets of API servers with their own properties for load balancing. A single API server is simple in design. It listens to block updates and maintains a processed version of the blockchain state to serve to clients. On requests, it forwards those to the nodes and relays the response back to the client. The API server’s in-memory representation of the blockchain state allows Hyperliquid to serve an API that is familiar to automated traders on centralized exchanges. Furthermore, the permissionless API server model solves the issue of load balancing and DDOS protection much like sentry nodes in other network designs. REST vs WS The API serves two sources of data, REST and Websocket. Under the hood, orders and cancels are relayed to the consensus RPC, which gossips the transactions to all the nodes and respond to the original request once it's included in the block and that block is committed. Websocket is maintained by a replica state that runs parallel to consensus and pushes updates when the blocks are created. Both systems handle load differently, since the consensus is running as a separate process on each node machine, but the websocket process is running in the same process as the state machine updates. Therefore it's not guaranteed that the timestamps from interleaving the two sources will be consistent.",
    "Clearinghouse: Describes the clearinghouse system for managing trades and settlements. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/clearinghouse. Clearinghouse The perps clearinghouse is the core component of the exchange state on the Hyperliquid L1. It manages the perps margin state for each address, which includes balance and positions. Deposits are first credited to an address's cross margin balance. Positions by default are also opened in cross margin mode. Isolated margin is also supported, which allows users to allocate margin towards a specific position, disassociating the liquidation risk of that position with all other positions. The spot clearinghouse analogously manages spot user state for each address, including token balances and holds.",
    "Oracle: Information on the oracle service providing reliable external data. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/oracle. Oracle The validators are responsible for publishing spot oracle prices for each perp asset every 3 seconds. The oracle prices are used to compute funding rates. They are also a component in the mark price which is used for margining, liquidations, and triggering TP/SL orders. The spot oracle prices are computed by each validator as the weighted median of Binance, OKX, Bybit, Kraken, Kucoin, Gate IO, MEXC, and Hyperliquid spot prices for each asset, with weights 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 respectively. Perps on assets which have primary spot liquidity on Hyperliquid spot do not incorporate external sources until sufficient liquidity is met. The final oracle price used by the clearinghouse is the weighted median of each validator's submitted oracle prices, where the validators are weighted by their stake.",
    "Order book: Insights into the order book structure and trading mechanisms. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/order-book. Order book Hyperliquid L1 state includes an order book for each asset. The order book works in essentially the same way as all centralized exchanges. Orders are added where price is an integer multiple of the tick size, and size is an integer multiple of lot size. The orders are matched in price-time priority. Operations on the order book take a reference to the clearinghouse, as all positions and margin checks are handled there. Margin checks happen on the opening of a new order, and again for the resting side at the matching of each order. This ensures that the margining system is consistent despite oracle price fluctuations after the resting order is placed.",
    "Multi-Sig: Overview of multi-signature wallets and their functionalities. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-l1/multi-sig. Multi-Sig Advanced Feature (Testnet-only) The Hyperliquid L1 supports native multi-sig actions in addition to normal L1 actions. This allows multiple private keys to control a single account for additional security. Unlike other chains, multi-sig is available as a built-in primitive on the L1 as opposed to relying on smart contracts. The multi-sig workflow is described below: To convert a user to a multi-sig user, the user sends a ConvertToMultiSigUser action with the authorized users and the minimum required number of authorized users required to sign an action. Authorized users must be existing users on the L1. Once a user has been converted into a multi-sig user, all its actions must be sent via multi-sig. To send an action, each authorized user must sign a payload to produce a signature. A MultiSig action wraps around any normal action and includes a list of signatures from authorized users. The MutiSigpayload also contains the target multi-sig user and the authorized user who will ultimately send the MultiSig action to the L1. The sender of the final action is also known as the leader of the multi-sig action. When a multi-sig action is sent, only the nonce set of the authorized user who sent the transaction is validated against and updated. Similarly to normal actions, the leader address can also be an API wallet of an authorized user. In this case, the nonce of the API wallet is checked and updated. A multi-sig user's set of authorized users and/or the threshold may be updated by sending a MultiSig action wrapping aConvertToMultiSigUser action describing the new state. A multi-sig user can be converted back to a normal user by sending a ConvertToMultiSigUser via multi-sig. In this case, the set of authorized users can be set to empty and conversion to normal user will be performed. Misc notes: A user can be a multi-sig user and an authorized user for another multi-sig user at the same time. A user may be an authorized user for multiple multi-sig users. The maximum allowed number of authorized users for a given multi-sig user is 10. See the Python SDK for code examples.",
    "HIP-1: Native token standard: Proposal for the native token standard. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips/hip-1-native-token-standard. HIP-1: Native token standard HIP-1 is a capped supply fungible token standard. It also features onchain spot order books between pairs of HIP-1 tokens. The sender of the token genesis transaction will specify the following: name: human readable, maximum 6 characters, no uniqueness constraints. weiDecimals: the conversion rate from the minimal integer unit of the token to a human-interpretable float. For example, ETH on EVM networks has weiDecimals = 18 and BTC on Bitcoin network has weiDecimals = 8. szDecimals: the minimum tradable number of decimals on spot order books. In other words, the lot size of the token on all spot order books will be 10 ** (weiDecimals - szDecimals). It is required that szDecimals + 5 <= weiDecimals. maxSupply: the maximum and initial supply. The supply may decrease over time due to spot order book fees or future burn mechanisms. initialWei: optional genesis balances specified by the sender of the transaction. This could include a multisig treasury, an initial bridge mint, etc. anchorTokenWei the sender of the transaction can specify existing HIP-1 tokens to proportionally receieve genesis balances. hyperliquidityInit: parameters for initializing the Hyperliquidity for the USDC spot pair. See HIP-2 section for more details. The deployment transaction of the token will generate a globally unique hash by which the L1 will index the token. Gas cost for deployment Like all L1 transactions, gas costs will ultimately be paid in the native Hyperliquid token. During the alpha phase before the native token exists, the following gas cost is in USDC. The gas cost of deployment is decided through a dutch auction with duration 31 hours. In this period, the deployment gas decreases linearly from initial_price to 10000 USDC . The initial price is 10000 USDC if the last auction failed to complete, otherwise 2 times the last gas price. Genesis to existing anchor tokens holders are proportional to balance - 1e-6 * anchorTokenMaxSupplyat the time of the deployed token's genesis. If this value is negative, no genesis tokens are received. In particular, this means genesis holders must hold at least 0.0001% of the anchor token's max supply at genesis to be included in the deployed token's genesis. Potential workaround for constraint (2): a small initial USDC gas fee (value TBD) for the initial L1 state update of each (address, token) pair, either through trading or transfer. Further trades and transfers to initialized ledgers are gas free within the standard Hyperliquid L1 fill rate conditions. IMPORTANT GAS DETAILS: The only time-sensitive step of the process is the very first step of deploying the token, where the deployer specifies name, szDecimals, and weiDecimals. This step is when the gas is charged and the token is locked in. It is recommended to take all the necessary time after this step to reduce errors. There is no time limit once the gas is paid. Deployment is a complex multi-stage process, and it is possible to get in a state where your deployment is stuck. For example, Hyperliquidity and total supply may be incompatible. It is the deployer's responsibility to try the exact deployment on testnet first: https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/deploySpot. Gas cannot be refunded if the deployment is stuck. USDC USDC is the only bridged token natively secured by the validators of the Hyperliquid L1. USDC is currently used for all perps margining. With HIP-1, USDC also becomes a spot token with an atomic transfer between perps and spot wallet USDC. Spot USDC has szDecimals = weiDecimals = 8 to allow for a wide range of HIP-1 token prices. Spot trading HIP-1 tokens trade on order books parametrized by base and quote tokens, where limit orders are commitments to exchange sz * 10 ** (weiDecimalsBase - szDecimalsBase) units of the base token for px * sz * 10 ** (weiDecimalsQuote - szDecimalsQuote) units of the quote token. Any HIP-1 token will be initialized with a native spot order book where the quote token is Spot USDC. Trading of arbitrary pairs of native tokens can be enabled in the future. Trading fees Native spot and perps order books share the same volume-based fee schedule for each address. Fees collected in non-USDC HIP-1 native tokens are currently burned as there is no mechanism implemented to accrue these to HLP. In the future, token fees could accrue to the respective Hyperliquidity strategy, native token stakers, or otherwise. Spot dust conversion Spot dusting occurs once a day at 00:00 UTC. All spot balances that are less than 1 lot size with notional value <= 1 USD will be dusted. Here, the notional value is computed as the prevailing mid price of the token against USDC, times the token balance. All users’ dust across a token is aggregated, and a market sell order is automatically submitted to the book. If the aggregate dust is smaller than one lot size, then that dust is burned. Otherwise, the USDC from the successfully converted dust will be allocated back to all dusted users on a weighted basis, where the weighting is equal to the user’s fraction of the aggregate dust. Dusting will not occur if 1) the book is one-sided or 2) the amount of notional dust is too high such that the book would be impacted by this operation. For PURR, this is 10000 USDC; for all other tokens, this is 3000 USDC. Note: the amount of USDC received may be less than the notional amount computed from the mid because of slippage incurred while dusting or if there was insufficient liquidity to convert the total dust across all users.",
    "HIP-2: Hyperliquidity: Proposal for enhancing liquidity on the platform. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/hyperliquid-improvement-proposals-hips/hip-2-hyperliquidity. HIP-2: Hyperliquidity Motivation Though HIP-1 is sufficient as a permissionless token standard, in practice it is often crucial to bootstrap liquidity. One of Hyperliquid's core design principles is that liquidity should be democratized. For perps trading, HLP can quote deep and tight liquidity based on CEX perp and spot prices, but a new model is needed for HIP-1 tokens that are in early phases of price discovery. Hyperliquidity is inspired by Uniswap, while interoperating with a native onchain order book to support sophisticated order book liquidity from end users. HIP-2 is a fully decentralized onchain strategy that is part of the block transition logic of the Hyperliquid L1. Unlike conventional automated order book strategies, there are no operators. The strategy logic is secured by the same consensus that operates the order book itself. Hyperliquidity is parametrized by spot: a spot order book asset with USDC quote returned by a deployment of HIP-1 startPx: the initial price of the range nOrders: the number of orders in the range orderSz: the size of a full order in the range nSeededLevels: the number of levels that begin as bids instead of asks. Note that for each additional bid level added by incrementing nSeededLevels the deployer needs to fund Hyperliquidity with px * sz worth of USDC. For fixed nOrders, increasing seeded levels decreases the total supply because it reduces the genesis supply of Hyperliquidity. Each Hyperliquidity strategy has a price range defined recursively px_0 = startPx, px_i = round(px_{i-1} * 1.003). The strategy updates on every block where the block time is at least 3 seconds since the previous update block. After each update: Strategy targets nFull = floor(balance / orderSz) full ask orders and a balance % orderSz partial ask order if the partial order is nonzero. To the extent that ALO orders are not rejected, these orders are ensured. Each fully filled tranche is modified to an order of side orderSz on the side with available balance, with the exception of the single partial order from (1) if it exists. The resulting strategy guarantees a 0.3% spread every 3 seconds. Like smart-contract based pools on general purpose chains, Hyperliquidity requires no maintenance in the form of user transactions. One key improvement is that Hyperliquidity participates in a general purpose order book. Active liquidity providers can join in liquidity provision alongside Hyperliquidity at any time, allowing markets to adapt to increasing demand for liquidity.",

    "Contract specifications: Technical specifications of trading contracts. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/contract-specifications. Contract specifications Hyperliquid perpetuals are derivatives products without expiration date. Instead, they rely on funding payments to ensure convergence to the underlying spot price over time. See Funding for more information. Hyperliquid has one main style of margining for perpetual contracts: USDC margining, USDT denominated linear contracts. That is, the oracle price is denominated in USDT, but the collateral is USDC. This allows for the best combination of liquidity and accessibility. Note that no conversions with the USDC/USDT exchange rate are applied, so these contracts are technically quanto contracts where USDT P&L is denominated in USDC. When the spot asset's primary source of liquidity is USDC denominated, the oracle price is denominated in USDC. Currently, the only USDC-denominated perpetual contracts are PURR-USD and HYPE-USD, where the most liquid spot oracle source is Hyperliquid spot. Hyperliquid's contract specifications are simpler than most platforms. There are few contract-specific details and no address-specific restrictions.

    "Fees: Detailed breakdown of the fees for trading on the platform. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/fees. Fees Starting on March 11, fees are based on your rolling 14 day volume, i.e., the first day for which volume counted toward fee tracking was February 26. Sub-account volume counts toward the master account and all sub-accounts share the same fee tier. Vault volume is treated separately from the master account. Referral discounts and referral rewards only apply to your first $25M in volume. Maker rebates are paid out continuously on each trade directly to the trading wallet. Users can claim referral rewards from the Referrals page. On most other protocols, the team or insiders are the main beneficiaries of fees. On Hyperliquid, fees are entirely directed to the community (HLP and the assistance fund). For security, the assistance fund holds a majority of its assets in HYPE, which is the most liquid native asset on the Hyperliquid L1. The assistance fund uses the system address 0xfefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefe which operates entirely onchain as part of the L1 execution. The assistance fund requires validator quorum to use in special situations. During the first three months of mainnet closed alpha, trading required zero gas and zero fees. Trading fees were introduced in June 2023 at a flat 2.5 bps taker and 0.2 bps maker rebate. Referrers received 10% of their referees' taker fees. Check the documentation for updated numbers.",
    "Builder codes: Explanation of builder codes and their uses. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/builder-codes. Builder codes Note: The term builder in the context of builder codes does not refer to block builders within consensus, but rather defi builders who build applications on the Hyperliquid L1. Builder codes allow builders to receive a fee on fills that they send on behalf of a user. They are set per-order for maximal flexibility. The user must approve a maximum builder fee for each builder, and can revoke permissions at any time. Builder codes are processed entirely onchain as part of the L1 fee logic. In order to use builder codes, the end user would first approve a max fee for the builder address via the ApproveBuilderFee action. This action must be signed by the user's main wallet, not an agent/API wallet. The builder must have at least 100 USDC in perps account value. Builder codes currently only apply to fees that are collected in USDC, i.e. builder codes do not apply to the buying side of spot trades. Builder fees charged can be at most 0.1% on perps and 1% on spot. Once the authorization is complete, future order actions sent on behalf of the user may include an optional builder parameter: {b: address, f: number}. b is the address of the builder and f is the builder fee to charge in tenths of basis points. I.e. a value of 10 means 1 basis point. Builders can claim fees from builder codes through the usual referral reward claim process. For example code see the Python SDK https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/basic_builder_fee.py API for builders The approved maximum builder fee for a user can be queried via an info request. The total builder fees collected for a builder is part of the referral state response from info request.

See this section on the Hyperliquid L1 overview for further details on order book implementation.",
    "Order types: Types of orders supported, including their functionalities. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/order-types. Order types Order types: Market: An order that executes immediately at the current market price Limit: An order that executes at the selected limit price or better Stop Market: A market order that is activated when the price reaches the selected stop price. Stop orders are generally used to help limit losses and lock in profits Stop Limit: A limit order that is activated when the price reaches the selected stop price Scale: Multiple limit orders in a set price range TWAP: A large order divided into smaller suborders and executed in 30 second intervals. TWAP suborders have a maximum slippage of 3%. TWAP details: During execution, a TWAP order attempts to meet an execution target which is defined as the elapsed time divided by the total time times the total size. A suborder is sent every 30 seconds during the course of the TWAP. A suborder is constrained to have a max slippage of 3%. When suborders do not fully fill because of market conditions (e.g., wide spread, low liquidity, etc.), the TWAP may fall behind its execution target. In this case, the TWAP will try to catch up to this execution target during later suborders. These later suborders will be larger but subject to the constraint of 3 times the normal suborder size (defined as total TWAP size divided by number of suborders). It is possible that if too many suborders did not fill then the TWAP order may not fully catch up to the total size by the end. Like normal market orders, TWAP suborders do not fill during the post-only period of a network upgrade. Order options: Reduce Only: An order that reduces a current position as opposed to opening a new position in the opposite direction Good Til Cancel (GTC): An order that rests on the order book until it is filled or canceled Post Only (ALO): An order that is added to the order book but doesn’t execute immediately. It is only executed as a resting order Immediate or Cancel (IOC): An order that will be canceled if it is not immediately filled Take Profit: An order that triggers when the Take Profit (TP) price is reached. Stop Loss: An order that triggers when the Stop Loss (SL) price is reached TP and SL orders are often used by traders to set targets and protect profits or minimize losses on positions. TP and SL are automatically market orders. You can set a limit price and configure the amount of the position to have a TP or SL",
    "Take-profit and stop-loss orders: Instructions on setting TP/SL orders. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/take-profit-and-stop-loss-orders-tp-sl. Take profit and stop loss orders (TP/SL) TP/SL orders close your position when a certain profit (resp. loss) has realized on your position. The mark price is used to trigger TP/SL orders. TP/SL orders can be dragged on the TradingView chart. Note that dragging in a way that causes the order to immediately execute will lead to an error. Usually this prevents user mistakes, but if this is your desired behavior you can manually close the order from the position table or order form. Limit vs Market TP/SL orders Users can choose between TP/SL market and limit orders. TP/SL market orders have a slippage tolerance of 10%. By setting the limit price on TP/SL orders, users can control the slippage tolerance of a triggered order. The more aggressive the limit price, the more likely the TP/SL order will be filled upon triggering, but the higher the potential slippage upon filling. As a concrete example, a SL order to close a long with trigger price $10 and limit price $10 will hit the book when the mark price drops below $10. If the price drops from $11 to $9 instantly it is quite likely this SL order would rest at $10 instead of filling. However, if the limit price were $8 instead of $10, it's likely to fill at some price between $9 and $8. TP/SL associated with a position TP/SL opened from the position form will have a size equal to the entire position by default. These orders will attempt to close the entire position at the time of trigger. If a specific size is configured on these TP/SL orders, they will be fixed-sized (i.e. they will not resize with the position after being placed). Position TP/SL orders are the most beginner-friendly because they have simple placement and cancelation criteria. TP/SL associated with a parent order (a.k.a one-cancels-other, OCO) This style of TP/SL is more complicated. Please read the below carefully to avoid unexpected outcomes. TP/SL opened from the order form have a fixed size equal to the order they are tied to. If the parent order is fully filled at placement, the children TP and/or SL orders are immediately placed. This behavior is similar to the TP/SL assocated with a position. When the parent order is not fully filled, the children orders enter and untriggered state. The TP/SL orders have not been placed, and upon cancelation of an unfilled parent order, the child TP/SL orders will be canceled. If the trader cancels a partially filled parent order, the child TP/SL orders are fully canceled as well. If the trader desires a TP/SL for the partially filled size, they must do so manually, e.g. by placing a separate TP/SL orders associated with the new position. However, if the parent order is partially filled and then canceled due to insufficient margin, the TP/SL orders will be placed as if the order were fully filled. In conclusion, children TP/SL orders associated with a parent order will be placed if and only if the parent order fully fills or is partially filled followed by a cancelation for insufficient margin.",
    "Margining: Explanation of the margining system in trading. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/margining. Margining Margin computations follow similar formulas to major centralized derivatives exchanges. Margin Mode When opening a position, a margin mode is selected. Cross margin is the default, which allows for maximal capital efficiency by sharing collateral between all other cross margin positions. Isolated margin is also supported, which allows an asset's collateral to be constrained to that asset. Liquidations in that asset do not affect other isolated positions or cross positions. Similarly, cross liquidations or other isolated liquidations do not affect the original isolated position. Initial Margin and Leverage Leverage can be set by a user to any integer between 1 and the max leverage. Max leverage depends on the asset. The margin required to open a position is position_size * mark_price / leverage. The initial margin is used by the position and cannot be withdrawn for cross margin positions. Isolated positions support adding and removing margin after opening the position. Unrealized pnl for cross margin positions will automatically be available as initial margin for new positions, while isolated positions will apply unrealized pnl as additional margin for the open position. The leverage of an existing position can be increased without closing the position. Leverage is only checked upon opening a position. Afterwards, the user is responsible for monitoring the leverage usage to avoid liquidation. Possible actions to take on positions with negative unrealized pnl include partially or fully closing the position, adding margin (if isolated), and depositing USDC (if cross). Maintenance Margin and Liquidations Cross positions are liquidated when the account value (including unrealized pnl) is less than the maintenance margin times the total open notional position. The maintenance margin is currently set to half of the initial margin at max leverage. Isolated positions are liquidated by the same maintenance margin logic, but the only inputs to the computation are the isolated margin and the notional value of the isolated position.",
    "Liquidations: How liquidations are handled on the platform. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/liquidations. Liquidations Overview A liquidation event occurs when a trader's positions move against them to the point where the account equity falls below the maintenance margin. The maintenance margin is half of the initial margin at max leverage, which varies from 3-50x. In other words, the maintenance margin is between 1% (for 50x max leverage assets) and 16.7% (for 3x max leverage assets) depending on the asset. When the account equity drops below maintenance margin, the positions are first attempted to be entirely closed by sending market orders to the book. The orders are for the full size of the position, and may be fully or partially closed. If the positions are entirely or partially closed such that the maintenance margin requirements are met, any remaining collateral remains with the trader. If the account equity drops below 2/3 of the maintenance margin without successful liquidation through the book, a backstop liquidation happens through the liquidator vault. See Liquidator Vault explanation below for more details. When a cross position is backstop liquidated, the trader's cross positions and cross margin are all transferred to the liquidator. In particular, if the trader has no isolated positions, the trader ends up with zero account equity. When an isolated position is backstop liquidated, that isolated position and isolated margin are transferred to the liquidator. The user's cross margin and positions are untouched. During backstop liquidation, the maintenance margin is not returned to the user. This is because the liquidator vault requires a buffer to make sure backstop liquidations are profitable on average. In order to avoid losing the maintenance margin, traders can place stop loss orders or exit the positions before the mark price reaches the liquidation price. Liquidations use the mark price, which combines external CEX prices with Hyperliquid's book state. This makes liquidations more robust than using a single instantaneous book price. During times of high volatility or on highly leveraged positions, mark price may be significantly different from book price. It is recommended to use the exact formula for precise monitoring of liquidations. Liquidator Vault Backstop liquidations on Hyperliquid are democratized through the liquidator vault, which is a component strategy of HLP. Positions that are below 2/3 of the maintenance margin can be taken over by the liquidator vault. On average, backstop liquidations are profitable for the liquidator. On most venues, this profit goes to the exchange operator or privileged market makers who internalize the flow. On Hyperliquid, the pnl stream from liquidations go entirely to the community through HLP. Computing Liquidation Price When entering a trade, an estimated liquidation price is shown. This estimation may be inaccurate compared to the position's estimated liquidation price due to changing liquidity on the book. Once a position is opened, a liquidation price is shown. This price has the certainty of the entry price, but still may not be the actual liquidation price due to funding payments or changes in unrealized pnl in other positions (for cross margin positions). The actual liquidation price is independent on the leverage set for cross margin positions. A cross margin position at lower leverage simply uses more collateral. The liquidation price does depend on leverage set for isolated margin positions, because the amount of isolated margin allocated depends on the initial margin set. The precise formula for the liquidation price of a position is liq_price = price - side * margin_available / position_size / (1 - l * side) where l = 1 / MAINTENANCE_LEVERAGE side = 1 for long and -1 for short margin_available (cross) = account_value - maintenance_margin_required margin_available (isolated) = isolated_margin - maintenance_margin_required",
    "Entry price and PnL: Details on how entry price and profit/loss are calculated. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/entry-price-and-pnl. Entry price and PNL On the Hyperliquid DEX, entry price, unrealized pnl, and closed pnl are purely frontend components provided for user convenience. The fundamental accounting is based on margin (balance for spot) and trades. Perps Perp trades are considered opening when the absolute value of the position increases. In other words, longing when already long or shorting when already short. For opening trades, the entry price is updated to an average of current entry price and trade price weighted by size. For closing trades, the entry price is kept the same. Unrealized pnl is defined as side * (mark_price - entry_price) * position_size where side = 1 for a long position and side = -1 for a short position Closed pnl is fee + side * (mark_price - entry_price) * position_size for a closing trade and only the fee for an opening trade. Spot Spot trades use the same formulas as perps with the following modifications: Spot trades are considered opening for buys and closing for sells. Transfers are treated as buys or sells at mark price, and genesis distributions are treated as having entry price at 10000 USDC market cap. Note that while 0 is the correct answer as genesis distributions are not bought, it leads to undefined return on equity. Pre-existing spot balances are assigned an entry price equal to the first trade or send after the feature was enabled around July 3 08:00 UTC.",
    "Funding: Information about funding rates and calculations. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/funding. Funding Overview Funding rates for crypto perpetual contracts are a mechanism that is used to ensure the price of the contract stays close to the underlying asset's price. The funding rate is a periodic fee that is paid by one side of the contract (either long or short) to the other side. Funding is purely peer-to-peer and no fees are collected on the payments. The rate is calculated based on the difference between the contract's price and the spot price of the underlying asset. For consistency with CEXs, interest rate component is predetermined at 0.01% every 8 hours, which is 0.00125% every hour, or 11.6% APR paid to short. This represents the difference in cost to borrow USD versus spot crypto. The premium component fluctuates based on the difference between the perpetual contract's price and the underlying spot oracle price. If the contract's price is higher than the oracle price, the premium and hence the funding rate will be positive, and the long position will pay the short position. Conversely, if the contract's price is lower than the spot price, the funding rate will be negative, and the short position will pay the long position. The funding rate on Hyperliquid is paid every hour. The funding rate is added or subtracted from the balance the contract holders at the funding interval. Funding rates are designed to prevent large price disparities between the perpetual contract and the underlying asset. When the funding rate is high, it can incentivize traders to take the opposite position and help to bring the contract's price closer to the spot price of the underlying asset. Technical details Funding on Hyperliquid is designed to closely match the process used by centralized perpetual exchanges. The funding rate formula applies to 8 hour funding rate. However, funding is paid every hour at one eighth of the computed rate for each hour. The specific formula is Funding Rate (F) = Average Premium Index (P) + clamp (interest rate - Premium Index (P), -0.0005, 0.0005). The premium is sampled every 5 seconds and averaged over the hour. As described in the clearinghouse section, the oracle prices are computed by each validator as the weighted median of CEX spot prices for each asset, with weights depending on the liquidity of the CEX. premium = impact_price / oracle_price - 1 where impact_price = max(impact_bid_px - oracle_px, 0) - max(oracle_px - impact_ask_px, 0) and impact_bid_px and impact_ask_px are the average execution prices to tradeimpact_notional_usd on the bid and ask sides, respectively. See the contract specifications for the impact notional used, as well as other contract specific parameters. Funding on Hyperliquid is capped at 4%/hour. Note that this is much less aggressive capping than CEX counterparts. The funding cap and funding interval do not depend on the asset. Note that the funding payment at the end of the interval is position_size * oracle_price * funding_rate. In particular, the spot oracle price is used to convert the position size to notional value, not the mark price. Numerical Example Here is an explicit example computation: The interest rate is 0.01% (fixed). The perpetual contract is trading at a premium, with the impact bid price being $10,100, and the spot price at $10,000. The premium index is calculated as the difference between the two prices, which is $100 in this case. The funding interval is 1 hour. You hold a long position of 10 contracts, each representing 1 BTC. First, calculate the premium: Premium = (Impact bid price - Spot Price) / Spot Price = ($10,100 - $10,000) / $10,000 Premium = 0.01 (or 1%) Next, clamp the interest rate minus the premium rate at 0.05%: Clamped Difference = min(max(Interest Rate - Premium Rate, -0.05%), 0.05%) Clamped Difference = min(max(0.01% - 1%, -0.05%), 0.05%) Clamped Difference = min(max(-0.99%, -0.05%), 0.05%) Clamped Difference = -0.05% Now, calculate the funding rate: Funding Rate = Premium Rate + Clamped Difference Funding Rate = 1% + (-0.05%) Funding Rate = 0.95%",

    "Robust price indices: How robust price indices are computed and utilized. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/robust-price-indices. Robust price indices Hyperliquid makes use of several robust prices based on order book and external data to minimize risk of market manipulation. Oracle price is used to compute funding rates. This weighted median of CEX prices is robust because it does not depend on hyperliquid's market data at all. Oracle prices are updated by the validators approximately once every three seconds. Mark price is the median of the following prices: Oracle price plus a 150 second exponential moving average (EMA) of the difference between Hyperliquid's mid price and the oracle price The median of best bid, best ask, last trade on Hyperliquid Median of Binance, OKX, and Bybit perp mid prices If exactly two out of the three inputs above exist, the 30 second EMA of the median of best bid, best ask, and last trade on Hyperliquid is also added to the median inputs. Mark price is an unbiased and robust estimate of the fair perp price, and is used for margining, liquidations, triggering TP/SL, and computing unrealized pnl. Mark price is updated whenever validators publish new oracle prices. Therefore, mark and oracle price are updated approximately once every 3 seconds. The EMA update formula is defined as follows for an update value of sample at duration t since the last update ema = numerator / denominator numerator -> numerator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + sample * t denominator -> denominator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + t",

    "Index perpetual contracts: Overview of index perpetuals and their benefits. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/index-perpetual-contracts. Index perpetual contracts Index contracts track a formula instead of a spot asset price as the underlying index, but otherwise function exactly the same as normal perpetual contracts. Instead of tracking the median price across a set of liquid CEXs, index perpetual contracts require the validators to periodically publish the value of the index formula to the Hyperliquid L1. The median of these reported values are then used in place of the spot oracle formula to compute funding rates. NFTI-USD NFTI-USD is an index of blue-chip NFT collections, including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, DeGods, Pudgy Penguins, and Milady Maker. The index is a 3-minute EMA of the aggregate floor price. The aggregate floor price is sum of the floor price of each collection, with BAYC divided by 10. Floor prices are computed by aggregating OpenSea and Blur. CryptoPunks were not included because they predate the NFT standard and are not listed on these marketplaces. Floor prices are converted to USDT using the ETH-USDT spot oracle price Index = 3 minute ema of [(BAYC floor price / 10) + (MAYC floor price) + (Azuki floor price) + (DeGods floor price) + (Pudgy Penguins floor price) + (Milady Maker floor price)] / 10000 FRIEND-USD FRIEND-USD is the first index perpetual contract listed by Hyperliquid. Previously based on community feedback, the top 20 friendtech index rebalanced biweekly. The top subjects were announced by EOD Monday UTC every other week, and the rebalance occured at 14:30 UTC on Wednesday every other week. The scale factor was set at time of rebalance so that the perp index value has a continuous change between old and new index definitions. The criterion for choosing subjects is top 20 subjects by price, 5k twitter followers, and filtering out outliers in trading activity and number of holders. If the community detects manipulation in a pending index change, the criterion may be adjusted accordingly. Beginning October 4, theFRIEND-USDindex will track the average one-share buy price of the middle 8 subjects of the following 20 accounts: 0xCaptainLevi, Dingalingts, 0xRacerAlt, HsakaTrades, HerroCrypto, HanweChang, Christianeth, 0xLawliette, CL207, Cryptoyieldinfo, CapitalGrug, iloveponzi, cobie, sayinshallah, pokeepandaa, pranksy, VentureCoinist, 0xBreadguy, saliencexbt, blknoiz06.

From September 13-20, the median price of the above 20 subjects was used instead of the average one-share buy price of the middle 8 subjects. The median price was scaled by 0.002469 to ensure a continuous transition from the previous index oracle (dated August 23-September 13).

    "HyperPs: Overview of HyperPs and their use cases. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/hyperps. Hyperps High level summary Hyperps (Hyperliquid-only perps) trade like perpetual contracts that users are familiar with, but do not require an underlying spot or index oracle price. Instead, the funding rate is determined relative to a moving average hyperp mark price in place of the usual spot price. This makes the hyperp price more stable and less susceptible to manipulation, unlike usual pre-launch futures. This new derivative design does not require an underlying asset or index that exists at all points of the hyperp's lifetime, only that the underlying asset or index eventually exists for settlement or conversion. When trading hyperps, funding rates are very important to consider. If there is heavy price momentum in one direction, funding will heavily incentivize positions in the opposite direction for the next eight hours. As always, be sure to understand the contract before trading. Conversion to vanilla perps For a hyperp tracking ABC (e.g. ABC = ZRO, TIA, PYTH, JUP, W, STRK), shortly after when ABC/USDT is listed on Binance, OKX, or Bybit spot trading, ABC-USD will convert to a normal ABC-USD perp. Open interest caps ZRO, TIA, PYTH, JUP, W, and STRK hyperps launched with $1000000 open interest cap to start. This limit may be relaxed as the market matures. Hyperp mechanism details Hyperps work just like normal perpetual contracts, except the external spot/index oracle price is replaced with an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last day's minutely mark prices. Precisely, oracle_price(t) = min[sum_{i=0}^1439 [(t - i minutes < t_list ? initial_mark_price : mark_price(t - i minutes)) * exp(-i/480)] * (1 - exp(-1/480)) / (1 - exp(-3)), intial_mark_price * 4] Here a ? b : c evaluates to b if a is true and otherwise c. Samples are taken on the first block after each unix minute, but the timestamps used are the nearest exact minute multiples. When there are fewer than 480 mark price samples, the initial mark price is used as the padding value. Funding rate premium samples are computed as 5% of the usual clamped interest rate and premium formula. See Funding docs for more details. Note that the oracle price is also restricted to be at most 4 times the one month average mark price as an additional safeguard against manipulation.",

    "Protocol vaults: Details on protocol-managed vaults. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/vaults/protocol-vaults. Protocol vaults Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) is a protocol vault that does market making and liquidations and receives a portion of trading fees. HLP democratize strategies typically reserved for privileged parties on other exchanges. The community can provide liquidity for the vault and share its PNL. HLP does not have additional profit share for vault owners; it is fully community-owned. The deposit lock-up period is 4 days. This means you can withdraw 4 days after your most recent deposit. E.g., if you deposited on Sep 14 at 08:00, you would be able to withdraw on Sep 18 at 08:00. For more information about HLP, see these blog posts: https://medium.com/@hyperliquid/hyperliquidity-provider-hlp-democratizing-market-making-bb114b1dff0f https://medium.com/@hyperliquid/hlp-update-3-months-in-42327abe3e57 Previous Vaults Next",
    "For vault leaders: Information specific to vault leaders. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/vaults/for-vault-leaders. For vault leaders What are the benefits of creating a vault as a leader? Vault leaders receive a 10% profit share for managing the vault. Vaults can be a great way for a trader to share strategies with his or her community. How do I create a vault? Anyone can create their own vault. It just takes 2 steps: Choose a name and write a description for your vault. Note: This cannot be changed later. Deposit a minimum of 100 USDC into your vault To ensure vault leaders have skin in the game, you must maintain ≥5% of the vault at all times. You cannot withdraw from your vault if it would cause your share to fall below 5%. How do I manage my vault? On the Trade page, select the address dropdown in the nav bar. Select the vault you want to trade on behalf of in the dropdown. Now, all trades you make will apply to your vault, and everything on the Trade page will reflect your vault. To switch back to your personal account, select Master at the top of the address dropdown. How do I close my vault? On your vault’s dedicated page, click the Leader Actions dropdown and select “Close Vault”. A modal will appear to confirm that you want to close your vault. All positions must be closed before the vault can close. All depositors will receive their share of the vault when it is closed. What happens to open positions in a vault when someone withdraws? When someone withdraws from a vault, if there is enough initial margin to keep the open positions according to the leverages set, the withdrawal does not affect open positions. If there is not enough initial margin for the open positions, a proportional amount of the withdrawal is closed for all open positions. For example, if a user comprised 10% of the vault’s total deposits, 10% of all open positions would be closed when they withdraw. This way, the liquidation price of any open orders stays in a similar range. Vault leaders can also set vaults to always proportionally close positions on withdrawals to maintain similar liquidation prices for positions. Open orders that are using margin will be canceled when there is insufficient margin for a withdrawal. Orders will be canceled in increasing order of margin used.",
    "For vault depositors: Guidelines for depositors in vaults. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/vaults/for-vault-depositors. For vault depositors What are the benefits of depositing into a vault? By depositing, you earn a share of the profits, or losses, of the vault. If there are specific traders you admire or support, you can deposit into their vault to get exposure to their trading strategies. Let’s say you deposit 100 USDC into a vault, whose total deposits are 900 USDC. The vault total is now 1,000 USDC, and you represent 10% of the vault. Over time, the vault grows to be 2,000 USDC, while no one else has deposited or withdrawn from the vault. You elect to withdraw from the vault. You withdraw 200 USDC (10%) less 10 USDC (10% profit share to the leader), which totals 190 USDC. There may be some slippage as you withdraw and open positions are closed. Note: Trading is inherently risky, and vaults’ past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. How do I find a vault to deposit into? On https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/vaults, you can view statistics of different vaults, including APY and total deposits (TVL). You can click on a specific vault to see more information, such as P&L, max drawdown, volume, open positions, and trade history. You can see how many people have deposited into the vault and for how long they’ve been supporting the vault. How do I deposit into a vault? Depositing into a vault is simple. On a vault’s dedicated page, enter the amount you would like to deposit and click “Deposit.” How do I check the performance of vaults I’ve deposited into? You can track any vault’s performance on its dedicated page. Select the “Your Performance” heading to see how your deposits in the pool have performed. On the Portfolio page, you’ll find your total balance across all vaults. How do I withdraw from a vault? Withdrawing is just as simple as depositing. On a vault’s dedicated page, click the Withdraw heading, then enter the amount you’d like to withdraw and click “Withdraw.” HLP has a lock-up period of 4 days. User vaults have a lock-up period of 1 day",

    "Risks: Risks associated with using the Hyperliquid platform. https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/risks. Risks Smart Contract Risk The onchain Perp DEX depends on the correctness and security of the Arbitrum bridge smart contracts. Bugs or vulnerabilities in the smart contracts could result in the loss of user funds. L1 Risk Hyperliquid runs on its own L1 which has not undergone as extensive testing and scrutiny as other established L1s like Ethereum. The network maybe experience downtime due to consensus or other issues. Market Liquidity Risk As a relatively new protocol, there could be a potential risk of low liquidity, especially in the early stages. This can lead to significant price slippage for traders, negatively affecting the overall trading experience and possibly leading to substantial losses. Oracle Manipulation Risk Hyperliquid relies on price oracles maintained by the validators to supply market data. If an oracle is compromised or manipulated for an extended period of time, the mark price could be effected and liquidations could occur before the price reverts to its fair value. Risk Mitigation There are additional measures in place to prevent oracle manipulation attacks on less liquid assets. One such restriction is open interest caps, which are based on a combination of liquidity, basis, and leverage in the system. When an asset hits the open interest cap, no new positions can be opened. Furthermore, orders cannot rest further than 1% from the oracle price. HLP is exempt from these rules in order to continue quoting liquidity.",

    "Bug bounty program: https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/bug-bounty-program Bug bounty program In Scope On mainnet, any bug that would cause an outage or logical error on nodes or API servers is in scope. On testnet, the EVM and its interaction with native components are also in scope. Note that because the EVM is not live on mainnet, the bounty payment for EVM bugs will not match a mainnet bug of the same severity. Other experimental features on testnet are not in scope, unless otherwise announced, though bug reports are still appreciated for these features. Submission Process Write a report regarding the bug and include detailed reproduction steps and a proof of concept to validate your findings. Submit your report to bugbounty@hyperfoundation.org. If the same bug is reported by multiple individuals or entities, the first report will be honored. Rewards will be paid in USDC on Hyperliquid for responsible disclosure of bugs based on their severity. We agree not to pursue legal action in respect of any research conducted in good faith and in compliance with this program. The time and energy that go into all bug reports is deeply appreciated. Prohibited Activity Testing on mainnet code; all testing should be done on testnet or local forks. Phishing or other social engineering attacks. Extended, large scale DDOS attacks. Attacks involving mishandling of temporary spikes in load are allowed. Testing with third-party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks). Submitting ransom demands or threats. Publicly disclosing a bug report before it has been fixed and paid. Threatening to publish or publishing anyone’s personally identifiable information or other sensitive information without their consent.

You must maintain confidentiality regarding vulnerabilities and communications until authorized for disclosure by us. We must be able to reproduce your findings. All bounty submissions will be paid out based on their classification. Classification examples are subject to change. Contributors to the development of the code being tested are not eligible to participate in the program in relation to such code. Ineligibility Reports lacking sufficient detail, including step-by-step instructions, reproducible examples, or proof of concept. Vulnerabilities that require highly unlikely or unreasonable user behavior to exploit. Vulnerabilities caused by outdated software, unpatched browsers, or systems no longer supported by Hyperliquid. Vulnerabilities that rely on root access, jailbreaking, or other modifications to user devices. Issues within third-party libraries, extensions, tools, or applications that do not lead to a direct Hyperliquid vulnerability. Bugs or errors unrelated to security, such as minor performance issues. Bugs or errors contingent on extreme or unrealistic market conditions that do not reflect real-world scenarios. General Conditions Payment will not be made for submissions that do not meet the program’s requirements or that are excluded under the program’s scope or ineligibility criteria. We reserve the right to determine the validity and classification of any submission at our sole discretion. All submissions become the property of the Hyper Foundation. We reserve the right to use, modify, or disclose submissions for security purposes without requiring additional consent. Classification Examples Critical (<1M USDC): Significant loss of user funds. Violation of L1 invariants. High (<50k USDC): Network downtime that does not lead to incorrect state. Medium (<10k USDC): API server performance issues. For the avoidance of doubt, rewards are determined based on the severity of the issue reported, and payouts may vary within the ranges listed above. Severity is determined based on both impact and likelihood of occurrence.",
